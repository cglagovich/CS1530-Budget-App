To access the EnterBudget page, just relaunch and type in localhost:8080/EnterBudget in the browser, 
it will take you to the page where you can see the submit button. If you enter the budget name on the first blank, and the 
amount on the second blank and then hit the submit button underneath, the budget shoudl be added into the database.
To access the database, go to localhost:8080/h2-console The JDBC url is jdbc:h2:mem:zhiyi  User name: sa  No password
There is also a page that says Welcome!  It's localhost:8080/home
The login page is written in html and all the other stuff are written in Java spring. It's inside CS1530-Budget-App/BudgetTrackerWebapp/src/main/Login 
If there're any problems running them simultaneously, please separate them( all the login code is under the folder Login)
All the other codes are in java spring. They should work fine individually as presented in the demo.
